# -Credit_Risk_Analysis
##Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
In this project we use machine learning to predect the risk of cridet card base on 85 features .
We classify the crited card risk to high risk or low risk.
Our main challenge in this proplem is the inpalance data as high risk intances are very low coper to low risl instances.
We experiment with six diffrent mechine learning models to overcame the imbalance problem.
We present the results of each model in this file.
##Results:
